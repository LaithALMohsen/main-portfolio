A 3D robot model was designed on Blender in a slightly different style than usual, 
because usually the model is designed and then painted,
 but the robot was designed differently because drawings were added for the front, 
side and back views of the model and placed on models inside Blender,
 then the edges of the model were cut and glued together.
